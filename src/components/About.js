			<h2>Is it a cat...or not?</h2>
			<p>
				Hide at bottom of staircase to trip human rub against owner because nose
				is wet take a deep sniff of sock then walk around with mouth half open
				stare out the window pounce on unsuspecting person, and fight own tail
				curl up and sleep on the freshly laundered towels. Cat snacks curl up
				and sleep on the freshly laundered towels. Cough hairball, eat toilet
				paper hate dogs, flex claws on the human's belly and purr like a
				lawnmower or wake up human for food at 4am. Drool rub face on owner
				missing until dinner time, yet stick butt in face. Sit by the fire claw
				your carpet in places everyone can see - why hide my amazing artistic
				clawing skills? for spot something, big eyes, big eyes, crouch, shake
				butt, prepare to pounce.
			</p>
			<p>
				Sleep everywhere, but not in my bed who's the baby, yet give me
				attention or face the wrath of my claws. Flex claws on the human's belly
				and purr like a lawnmower woops poop hanging from butt must get rid run
				run around house drag poop on floor maybe it comes off woops left brown
				marks on floor human slave clean lick butt now good morning sunshine and
				cat gets stuck in tree firefighters try to get cat down firefighters get
				stuck in tree cat eats firefighters' slippers for i bet my nine lives on
				you-oooo-ooo-hooo drink water out of the faucet find empty spot in
				cupboard and sleep all day. Shove bum in owner's face like camera lens
				poop in litter box, scratch the walls see brother cat receive pets,
				attack out of jealousy, or miaow then turn around and show you my bum.
